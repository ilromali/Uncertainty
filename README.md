    Uncertainty is an action-adventure space-shooter game.
    <br />
    We are using this project as our "Software Engineering Lab" course project.
    <br />
    (Spring 2021)
  <br />


## About The Project:  
Uncertainty is a 3D game developed in Unity 2019.4.16f1,  
we plan to develop a space shooter action-packed adventure game based on boss fight mechanics.

## Project Requirements:  
### Functional Requirements:  
- The player can move the spaceship
- The player can fight enemies likewise, vice versa..
- There is a bossfight in the level

### Non-Functional Requirements:  
- Performance - In order to ensure smooth lagging-free performance on all computers, the game must be optimized
- Scalability - Software Architecture must be designed in such a way that the game can be expanded later on
- Reliability - The game should not crash or present any issues that cause it to malfunction
